Abstract (max. half a page)

Background: The following study examines the relationship of income level in between different genders and races. The data comes from the UCI Adult data set which was pulled 
from the 1994 UC Census Database. 

Methods: The study analyzes descriptive statistics, univariate regression, multivariate regression, residual model, and a Hosmer-Lemeshow test to further analyze the difference 
in gender and race being able to have an annual salary of above or below 50 thousand dollars. 

Results: The results show that there is a difference between gender pay as well as pay for various races. While using possible baseline confounding variables, 
an associated higher percentage of males making above 50 thousand dollars compared to females was observed. When exploring the relation of race using possible 
baseline confounding variables, individuals who identified as white were associated with being the most likely to make over 50 thousand dollars annually. 

Discussion: In 1994, there seemed to be a division of wealth within our country. When analyzing the data, a subset of individuals who identified as black women and 
individuals who identified as white men was made. The subset only consisted of individuals with the same education, worked 40 hours per week, and were between the ages of 
41 to 50. The white men were associated with being almost 35% more likely to make over 50 thousand dollars.
